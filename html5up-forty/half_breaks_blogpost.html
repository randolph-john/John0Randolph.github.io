          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>
            Picture the following scenario. It should be familiar if you've been
            to a bunch of frisbee tournaments.
          </p>
          <p>
            You walk up to a field to watch what looks like a tight, heated
            game. You ask, “who's up?” Someone says that the game is on serve.
            The problem here is that
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >your question hasn't been answered</span
            >. If the game continues as is (i.e., no more breaks), one of the
            two teams will win, but you haven't been told who.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily, someone else says that the first person was wrong. They say
            that team A is winning. “How much are they winning by?” you ask. The
            person says that Team A is up by 1 break. Again,
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >your question hasn't been answered</span
            >. Team A could be up by 0, 1, or 2 points at the given moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The above situation is why many players and coaches use half-break
            terminology. However, what should be standard terminology isn't
            universal and furthermore isn't fully understood by some players.
            The goal of this blog post is to explain the half-break system and
            why it is a serious upgrade over talking in full breaks.
          </p>
          <h2>The issue with full breaks</h2>
          <p>
            Before we can introduce half breaks, let's discuss the problems
            caused by using full-break terminology.
          </p>
          <p>
            The central issue with describing a game state using full breaks is
            that it fails to adequately communicate the state of the game. This
            shortcoming stems from the (unintuitively) faulty premise that when
            the both teams have the same score (such as at 0-0), the game is
            tied. That, however isn't true, because one team is receiving, which
            is an advantage equal to one half of a break.
          </p>
          <p>
            Put differently: there is never a “tied” situation in ultimate
            because there is always a team that will win if there are no more
            breaks (or, if you rather, are no more turnovers). At 13-13, it is
            obvious that the team receiving has an advantage, but this is just
            as true at 0-0.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's dive deeper into the lack of clarity provided by full-break
            terminology. Consider that all you know about the game state is that
            Team A is up by 1 (resp. n) breaks and that it is the second half of
            the game, which is a common situation. There are a few series of
            events that could have led to this.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Team A started on offense, then broke 1 (resp. n) time at any
              point during the game. Then, they are up by 1 or 2 (resp. n or
              n+1) points. On the points when they start on offense, they're up
              by 1 (resp. n), and when they start on defense, they're up by 2
              (resp. n+1).
            </li>
            <li id="footnote-1-reference">
              Team A started on defense, then broke 1 (resp. n) time in the
              first half. Likewise, they are up by 1 or 2 (resp. n or n+1)
              points <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Team A started on defense, then broke 1 (resp. n) time in the
              second half. They are up by 0 or 1 (resp. n-1 or n) points.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            From enumerating these situations it is clear that Team A can be
            ahead by 0, 1, or 2 (resp. n-1, n, n+1) points while being ahead by
            1 (resp. n) break.
          </p>
          <h2>The solution: half-breaks</h2>
          <p>
            Half-break terminology solves these issues by explicitly and
            correctly stating who is ahead, and by how much. When a team is
            ahead by 0 points when on offense and 1 point when receiving, that
            team is up half a break (and the other team is down by half a
            break). When a team is ahead by 3 to 4 points, that team is up by
            three-and-a-half breaks (and the other team is down by
            three-and-a-half breaks).
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that one team is <em>always</em> up; there are no ties in
            ultimate. Two teams having equal scores means that one team is up by
            half a break.
          </p>
          <p id="footnote-2-reference">
            Note also that in the first half, knowing which team started on
            offense or defense is still necessary to know the game outcome
            because that knowledge is necessary to know which team has the
            potential to earn the “double-break” by taking half after starting
            down half a break. This requirement is true when using full-break
            terminology, too <a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>.
          </p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Let's return to our original example, this time using half-break
            terminology.
          </p>
          <p>
            You walk up to a field to watch what looks like a tight, heated
            game. You ask, “who's up?” Someone says that team A is up half a
            break.
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >Your question has been answered</span
            >. If the game continues as is (i.e., no more breaks), you know that
            team A will win by 1 point. You look at the field - if team A is
            pulling, they are up by 1, and if they're receiving, they are up by
            0.
          </p>
          <p>
            Someone else says that the first person was wrong. They say that
            team A is winning. “How much are they winning by?” you ask. The
            person says that team A is up by a break and a half. Again,
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >your question has been answered</span
            >. You look at the field and immediately know whether team A is up
            by 1 or 2 points, depending on whether they are pulling or
            receiving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Full-break terminology is dead. Long live the half-break system!
          </p>

          <p id="footnote-1">
            <a href="#footnote-1-reference">[1]</a> Some would consider this
            being up by 2 breaks, as team A earned the so-called double-break by
            taking half after starting the game on defense. This is another
            source of ambiguity of full breaks that is clarified by using half
            breaks.
          </p>
          <p id="footnote-2">
            <a href="#footnote-2-reference">[2]</a> And that's even if you can
            get straight whether a team who started pulling and netted one break
            in the first half is up by 1 break or 2 in the second half!
