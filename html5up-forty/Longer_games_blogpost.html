          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>
            In my opinion, there should always be a balance of chance in sports,
            especially in the playoffs. The better team should win more often,
            but there should always lurk the possibility of a thrilling upset.
            Put to the extreme, skill has no meaning if the better team wins as
            often as they lose; and if the better team always wins, then there
            is no fun at all in the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this vein, playing to a higher point total causes the better team
            will win more often. If this isn't intuitively obvious to you,
            consider the following examples.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Is a pickup team more likely to beat 2016 Revolver in a game to 1
              or a game to 15?
            </li>
            <li>
              Are the 2012 Charlotte Bobcats more likely to beat the 1996
              Chicago Bulls in a single game or in a 7-game series?
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This relationship between variance and game length is true in less
            extreme examples, too - for instance, between two relatively evenly
            matched teams in the quarterfinals of club nationals, playing to 15.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this blog post, we'll explore how often the better team wins in
            big ultimate games, and how much changing the score total changes
            the likelihood that the better team wins.
          </p>
          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>
            We'll model the game as a series of independently points that can be
            won by either team
            <a id="footnote-1-reference" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. Then, if
            team A has probability p of winning any given point in a game to n
            points, the probability that they win the game is
          </p>
          <p>
            \(F1: \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} \frac{(n+i-1)!}{(n-1)! i!} (1-p)^i p^n \)
          </p>
          <p>
            We know that this is equal to the probability that team A beats team
            B, which we can calculate another way: from their elo rankings. That
            formula is
          </p>
          <p>\( F2: \frac{1}{1 + 10^{\frac{elo_B - elo_A}{400}}} \)</p>
          <p>
            With these two formulae, our approach becomes straightforward. From
            the USAU rankings, which give elo scores, we use F2 to calculate the
            expected chance of the better team winning. From there, we can
            invert F2 <a id="footnote-2-reference" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> to
            find the probability that the better team wins any given point under
            the constraints of our model
            <a id="footnote-3-reference" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a>. Then all we
            need to do is run that number back through F1 with various point
            totals and compare the outcomes.
          </p>
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
            For our range of possible Elo differences, let's look at historical
            data. The biggest difference at club nationals in 2023 was between
            Scandal (2606.7) and Pop (1402.13), for a whopping difference of
            1204.57 elo points
            <a id="footnote-4-reference" href="#footnote-3">[4]</a>. We'll start
            with this large range - anywhere up to 1200 elo points differential
            - and range the possible point totals from 1 to 25. Here's what
            those results look like:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img
              style="text-align: center"
              width="1000em"
              src="../images/1to25by100s.png"
              alt="Scatterplot of power rankings accuracy"
            />
          </figure>
          <p>A few takeaways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In a game to 15, anywhere more than a 400 point elo difference
              gives you a >=90% chance of winning
            </li>
            <li>
              In a game to 25, a 300 point elo difference should give the same
              odds of winning (>=90%) to the better team
            </li>
            <li>
              Even in a game to 1, Scandal has a 75% chance of beating Pop
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            But we can look more fine-grained. We know games are played to odd
            numbers in the teens, so we'll examine odd scores from 11 to 21.
            Furthermore, the games we care most about occur in the bracket at
            USAU nationals. So let's look at how big the elo gap is for those
            games. Here's that histogram:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img
              style="text-align: center"
              width="1000em"
              src="../images/EloDifferentialHistogram.png"
              alt="Scatterplot of power rankings accuracy"
            />
          </figure>
          <p>
            Most games in the bracket at nationals occur between teams that have
            less than or equal to about 300 elo points in ranking differential,
            with a somewhat flat distribution below that number. We'll
            accordingly restrict our examination window to below elo 300 points
            in ranking differential. Then, here's that data:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img
              style="text-align: center"
              width="1000em"
              src="../images/11to21by10s.png"
              alt="Scatterplot of power rankings accuracy"
            />
          </figure>
          <p>A few takeaways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Elo differential makes a much larger difference than point total
            </li>
            <li>
              We could play short games and be just fine - even in games to 11,
              the better team prevails nearly as often as they do in games to 15
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            The point total of a game affects the chance of the winning team
            less than I had anticipated. For example, in the men's final between
            Truck Stop (2499.23) and Machine (2189.71), increasing the game
            length from 15 to 19 only decreases Machine's chances by about four
            percent. In the more evenly matched semifinal between Hybrid
            (1823.85) and XIST (1920.86), increasing the game length to 19 only
            increases XIST's chances by about two and a half percent.
          </p>

            This blog post changed my mind. I came into writing it expecting it
            to be an argument for longer games from the standpoint of reducing
            volatility in winning. Now I see that the game length matters
            little, though
            <a href="Simulating_nationals_blogpost.html">
              there still is a huge amount of variance in the winners of
              nationals</a
            >
            any way about it.

            <a href="#footnote-1-reference">[1]</a> this is a flawed model,
            since holds and breaks are obviously not independent. But it will
            suffice for our purposes.

            <a href="#footnote-4-reference">[4]</a> This indicates that Pop has
