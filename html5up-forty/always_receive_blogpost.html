						<h2>Intro</h2>
                        <p>
                            Choosing to pull or receive is a choice that one team has every game. It's about as common a problem as comes up
                            in ultimate. It's also a well defined choice with an overwhelmingly clear theoretical answer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There may be good reasons to choose to pull to start the game (if the game is overwhelmingly upwind/downwind or you
                            believe your team benefits significantly by starting on defense). Those reasons (though unlikely and usually overestimated,
                            in my experience) may be well and good. But there is one very bad argument to choose to pull that is still floating
                            around the frisbee community - that if you break before half, we get an extra break. This blog post is a simple but
                            thorough proof that the “extra break” you receive is not a good reason to start pulling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This framework can be complex to imagine, even more so if you are trying to do it in the five seconds after you've
                            won the flip before you state what your choice is. However, if you take the time to draw out the possibilities,
                            the solution falls out easily and simply. I'm writing this blog post so that the next time someone brings up the
                            choose-to-pull-for-the-halftime-extra-break I can direct them here instead of trying to explain it to them.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Proof</h2>
                        <p>
                            At the start of the game, you can either to receive or pull. Here is every possibility that can occur
                        </p>

                            As is clear from this table, choosing to receive strictly dominates choosing to receive. The number of breaks you need
                            is generally the same in most situations, but going into half “on serve” you would rather have received to start the
                            game. Note that nowhere is there any advantage to choosing to pull to start.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another way to think of this is that the extra break you gain by breaking 1+ times before half (after starting pulling) exactly makes up for
                            the 1-break difference between pulling and receiving you forfeited by pulling to start (pulling = down half a break; receiving
                            = up half a break).
                        </p>
                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Unless there are other factors that are very impactful (unlikely), always choose to receive.</p>
