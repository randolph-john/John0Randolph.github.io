          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>
            Choosing to pull or receive is a choice that one team has every
            game. It's about as common a problem as comes up in ultimate. It's
            also a well defined choice with an overwhelmingly clear theoretical
            answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            There may be good reasons to choose to pull to start the game (if
            the game is overwhelmingly upwind/downwind or you believe your team
            benefits significantly by starting on defense). Those reasons
            (though unlikely and usually overestimated, in my experience) may be
            well and good. But there is one very bad argument to choose to pull
            that is still floating around the frisbee community - that if you
            break before half, we get an extra break. This blog post is a simple
            but thorough proof that the “extra break” you receive is not a good
            reason to start pulling.
          </p>
          <p>
            This framework can be complex to imagine, even more so if you are
            trying to do it in the five seconds after you've won the flip before
            you state what your choice is. However, if you take the time to draw
            out the possibilities, the solution falls out easily and simply. I'm
            writing this blog post so that the next time someone brings up the
            choose-to-pull-for-the-halftime-extra-break I can direct them here
            instead of trying to explain it to them.
          </p>
          <h2>Proof</h2>
          <p>
            At the start of the game, you can either to receive or pull. Here is
            every possibility that can occur

          <p>
            As is clear from this table, choosing to receive strictly dominates
            choosing to receive. The number of breaks you need is generally the
            same in most situations, but going into half “on serve” you would
            rather have received to start the game. Note that nowhere is there
            any advantage to choosing to pull to start.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another way to think of this is that the extra break you gain by
            breaking 1+ times before half (after starting pulling) exactly makes
            up for the 1-break difference between pulling and receiving you
            forfeited by pulling to start (pulling = down half a break;
            receiving = up half a break).
          </p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Unless there are other factors that are very impactful (unlikely),
            always choose to receive.
