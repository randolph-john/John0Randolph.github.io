          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>
            I've never been quite sure how to interpret the Ultiworld power
            rankings. I, like all ultimate players, care only about my team's
            finish at nationals. Therefore I usually view Ultiworld power
            rankings as an imprecise yardstick by which to measure my team's
            chances at nationals. I am always happy to see my team rise in the
            rankings and disappointed to see it fall. But how precise is the
            yardstick? If my team is ranked near the bottom or not at all, how
            much should we fret (how destined are we to lose?); if my team is
            ranked near the top, how much should we rejoice (how assured are we
            of success?)?
          </p>
          <p>
            To some degree, the rankings are accurate. If my team rises to #1 on
            the rankings, surely we are in a good spot to finish well at
            nationals; if my team falls from the rankings entirely, we will
            probably struggle at nationals, if we get there at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            The time of year matters too: at the beginning of the season, the
            predictions are probably less accurate. The data provided by
            tournaments should increase the precision of rankings as nationals
            approaches.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also wonder about rankings between divisions. Is the men's or
            women's division more accurate (or are they the same)? D1 or D3?
            College or club?
          </p>
          <h2>The approach</h2>
          <p>
            I'll dive in to a couple of these questions in this blog post.
            Hopefully one day I'll come back and expore more. We'll start with
            one basic case, and probably the best one: the men's and women's D1
            college divisions. Using these divisions has a few advantages over
            other divisions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              They have a long season. Over the season a steadily increasing
              amount of data is gathered about the teams through tournaments.
              The club season, in comparison, is shorter and has more sporadic
              tournament play
            </li>
            <li>
              Rosters are steady over the course of the season. In club, many
              rosters are smaller at early season tournaments, meaning the data
              gathered is less useful
            </li>
            <li id="footnote-1-reference">
              It is harder to predict solely from rosters in college than in
              club, meaning that the tournament data makes up a larger portion
              of the prediction <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              A larger number of Ultiworld contributors contribute to the D1
              rankings than the D3 rankings, meaning they are a more stable
              average of people's opinions
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We will use as our gold standard labels the placement of each team
            at nationals. This data is noisy as there's a lot of variance within
            a single tournament, but it is unbiased and we have plenty of data
            points between 16 teams x 8 seasons x 2 divisions. Nationals is all
            that anyone cares about, so it makes sense as our gold standard.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a few drawbacks with this approach. They are presented in
            <span style="font-weight: bold">bold</span> alongside how we will
            choose to address them.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >Due to the bid system, there are teams at nationals outside of
                the top 20.
              </span>
              We will ignore the bottom 4 finishing teams at nationals
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >Ultiworld's power rankings are not meant to be predictive of
                nationals finish.
              </span>
              Maybe. Ultiworld doesn't say on their site exactly what the power
              rankings are meant to convey, but it's likely that they are
              supposed to be predictions about the current strength of each
              team, ie if nationals was played on the day of the prediction.
              Even if they're not meant to be predictive we can still evaluate
              how predictive they are.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >What metric do we use to evaluate the accuracy of
                predictions?</span
              >
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient"
                >Spearman's ranking correlation coefficient (Spearman's rho)</a
              >
              is a widely-used measure of accuracy of ordinal rankings. In our
              setting, it only differs from
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error"
                >Mean Squared Error</a
              >
              by a constant factor, so we'll use MSE, as it is easier to
              interpret.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">What about ties?</span>
              We'll account for ties by setting the number to be the team's
              “correct” rank given the tie. For example, the four teams
              eliminated in quarterfinals who tie for 5th are each given a rank
              of 6.5 (halfway between 5th and 8th). Predictions of 5 and 8 are
              equally accurate for teams eliminated in quarters, as are
              predictions of 1 and 12.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >What about teams in Ultiworld's top 16 that don't qualify for
                nationals?</span
              >
              We'll give them a ranking of 21. There's is a valid argument to be
              had that this should be a bigger penalty, but at the end of the
              day this is an arbitrary judgement call.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >What about the 2020 and 2021 college seasons?</span
              >
              In 2020 nationals was cancelled. The 2021 series was a short
              season whose champions were largely determined by which teams were
              able to practice together and with other anomalies (essentially no
              regular season tournaments; uncertainty about school eligibility).
              We'll exclude both the 2020 and 2021 seasons.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: bold">What about BYU?</span>
              As BYU forfeits the series, we will remove them from the Ultiworld
              rankings.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
            These assumptions allow us to look at the accuracy over time of
            predictions in Ultiworld's power rankings for men's and women's
            college teams from 2014 to 2023. We can scrape Ultiworld and run the
            numbers to generate the following graph. The graph is below, with
            men's in red and women's in blue.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img
              style="text-align: center"
              width="1000em"

              alt="Scatterplot of power rankings accuracy"
            />
            <!-- <figcaption>Scatterplot of the accuracy of Ultiworld's power rankings as predictions of nationals finish.</figcaption> -->
          </figure>
          <p>There are a couple straightforward but interesting takeaways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Predictions in the women's division are generally a bit more
              accurate than the men's division
            </li>
            <li>
              In both divisions, predictions do get more accurate as nationals
              gets closer
            </li>
            <li>
              By nationals, predictions in the men's division are nearly as
              accurate as predictions in the women's division
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>That's about all I can learn from this graph.</p>
          <h2>Ultiworld vs USAU rankings</h2>
          <p>
            We can repeat this procedure to compare USAU rankings with Ultiworld
            rankings. There are a couple of drawbacks with the USAU data:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              USAU does not start ranking teams until the start of the spring
              season, so there are fewer rankings per season
            </li>
            <li>
              USAU did not calculate rankings for the 2022 season, so we only
              have 6 years of data
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Even so, there should be enough data. Here are three graphs, one
            which contains both divisions and two that each contain one
            division.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img
              style="text-align: center"
              width="1000em"
              src="../images/power_rankings_blog_post/BothBoth.png"
              alt="Scatterplot of power rankings accuracy"
            />
          </figure>
          <figure>
            <img
              style="text-align: center"
              width="1000em"
              src="../images/power_rankings_blog_post/BothMens.png"
              alt="Scatterplot of power rankings accuracy"
            />
          </figure>
          <figure>
            <img
              style="text-align: center"
              width="1000em"
              src="../images/power_rankings_blog_post/BothWomens.png"
              alt="Scatterplot of power rankings accuracy"
            />
          </figure>
          <p>Takeaways I see are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              USAU's rankings are consistently less accurate than Ultiworld's
              rankings - through the whole season, for both divisions
            </li>
            <li>
              USAU's rankings get more accurate as the season goes on, as
              Ultiworld's do
            </li>
            <li>
              Both USAU and Ultiworld rankings are less predictive in the men's
              divsion. Thus it appears the women's division is more predictable
            </li>
            <li>
              USAU's accuracy at the end of the season is similar to Ultiworld's
              accuracy at the beginning of the season
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            There's a lot more to be done with this framework. A few ideas: how
            accurate is D1 vs D3; club vs college? How much stability is there
            in each different division, over the course of the season and over
            the course of multiple seasons? Does Ultiworld systematically
            over-rank or under-rank groups of teams such as blue-blood teams,
            teams new on the scene, or teams from specific regions? Is there a
            way we can use the USAU and Ultiworld rankings to come up with
            significantly more accurate predictions than either? Hopefully I'll
            one day follow up with blog posts exploring each those questions.
